To Whom it May Concern:

This is a collection of my favorite projects. Below I have included a short description of the project, and a note of how much code from each file is mine.

Travling Salesman Project:
This is a project that I worked on for my Evolutionary Computation class. It's a classic problem, but I enjoyed going the extra mile here and paralellize the solution. There was provided code, but I took very little of it, opting to build a solution basically from scratch in order to structure it for parallelization. 
This code runs the traveling salesmam problem many times and collects statistics on the efficiency of the program. It currently displays graphs at the end for the amount of generations and the amount of time in milliseconds each run took. Five test cases run 64 times each. The test cases are for 10 cities, 15 cities, 20 cities, 25 cities, and 30 cities. The number of cities in each test case can easily be controlled by the switch statement at the top of the Main class.
The CityDistances.txt file and the MapBuilder.java file are the only files that are not mine.
